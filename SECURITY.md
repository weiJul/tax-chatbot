# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Tax Chatbot project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and guidelines for safe usage.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **Email** the maintainers directly (or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting)
4. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include
When reporting a security issue, please provide:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, and system specifications
- **Suggestions**: Any ideas for fixes (optional)

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with the reporter
5. **Release**: We'll release a patched version

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Security

#### Personal Information
- **Demo Data Only**: System uses fictional users for demonstrations
- **No Real PII**: No actual personal information is stored or processed
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens locally
- **No External Transmission**: User data is not sent to external services

#### Tax Documents
- **Public Documents**: System processes publicly available tax documents
- **No Sensitive Data**: No confidential or private tax information
- **Educational Use**: Intended for educational and research purposes

### System Security

#### Model Security
- **Local Models**: All AI models run locally (no external API calls)
- **Model Integrity**: Use checksums to verify model file integrity
- **Secure Storage**: Store models in protected directories

#### Database Security
- **SQLite Local**: Database runs locally with no network exposure
- **MCP Isolation**: Database access isolated through MCP protocol
- **No External Access**: No remote database connections

#### Network Security
- **No External APIs**: System doesn't make external API calls
- **Local Only**: All processing happens on local machine
- **No Data Transmission**: No data sent to external servers

### Access Control

#### File System Access
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: System accesses only necessary files
- **Configuration Security**: Secure configuration file handling
- **Log Security**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information

#### Process Isolation
- **MCP Server**: Database operations isolated in separate process
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages (no sensitive info)
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and resource usage limits

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
- **Verify Downloads**: Check repository authenticity
- **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate dependencies
- **Review Dependencies**: Check requirements.txt for security

#### Runtime Security
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch system resource usage
- **Secure Configuration**: Protect config files from unauthorized access
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

#### Data Handling
- **Backup Safely**: Secure any data backups
- **Access Control**: Limit access to system files
- **Clean Uninstall**: Properly remove system when no longer needed

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Sanitize error messages
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Code Reviews**: Review code for security issues

#### Development Environment
- **Secure Development**: Use secure development practices
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets or keys
- **Environment Isolation**: Use isolated development environments

## üö© Known Security Considerations

### AI/ML Specific Risks

#### Model Security
- **Model Poisoning**: Models trained on public data (verify sources)
- **Adversarial Inputs**: System may be vulnerable to crafted inputs
- **Prompt Injection**: LLM may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks

#### Data Privacy
- **Embedding Exposure**: Text embeddings might leak information
- **Model Memorization**: Large models may memorize training data
- **Inference Attacks**: Potential for inference attacks on user data

### System Limitations

#### Performance Attacks
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Large queries might exhaust system resources
- **Memory Attacks**: Crafted inputs might cause memory issues
- **DoS Vulnerability**: Repeated heavy queries might cause denial of service

#### Input Validation
- **Query Length**: Very long queries might cause issues
- **Special Characters**: Some characters might cause parsing problems
- **File Path Traversal**: Potential path traversal in file operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### Implemented Protections

#### Resource Management
- **Memory Limits**: Automatic GPU memory management
- **Query Timeouts**: Timeout protection for long-running queries
- **Batch Size Limits**: Limited batch sizes for processing

#### Input Sanitization
- **Query Validation**: Basic query validation and sanitization
- **File Path Security**: Secure file path handling
- **Error Sanitization**: Clean error messages without sensitive info

#### Process Security
- **MCP Isolation**: Database operations isolated via MCP protocol
- **Privilege Separation**: Minimal required privileges
- **Safe Defaults**: Secure default configurations

### Recommended Additional Protections

#### For Production Use
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement query rate limiting
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication if needed
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging
- **Network Security**: Firewall and network isolation

#### For Sensitive Environments
- **Air Gapping**: Run on isolated networks
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt stored data
- **Access Monitoring**: Monitor system access
- **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic security assessments
